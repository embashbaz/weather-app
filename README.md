# weather_app

Waether app for Craft Silicon Limited

## Running the code

add a file inside https://github.com/embashbaz/weather-app/tree/master/lib/data/remote/api and name it weather_res.dart
Add the following to the file
```
String BASE_URL = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast";
String API_KEY = PROVIDE_KEY;
```

With the Open weather map api key. 

Please note that the key provided was not working so I created a new one.
